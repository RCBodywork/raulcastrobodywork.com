I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible but Online Requests take precedence.  <br><br>If you are a new client please click on the link below to download the Client Intake Form.

<p><a target="_blank" href="RCB Intake New.pdf"><h2>New clients: please click here to download the intake form and bring the completed paperwork with you.<br> Please include as much detail as possible regarding your physical conditions so that I may better serve you on the day of your treatment.</h></a></p></div>
<br>

<p>NOTE:  If you have booked an appointment and find that you are feeling unwell or have been sick within the past 48 hours I highly recommend rescheduling your appointment.  Even if you are just getting the beginning symptoms it is far better to take care of yourself and protect your massage therapist and other clients from possible effects.  If you arrive for your appointment and are showing signs of illness you may be asked to return at another date.  I will afford this same courtesy to you and may have to cancel should I feel under the weather.  It's out of respect for each other.<br><br> 
<p>Please meet at the bench in front of Leela Yoga.  We will enter from behind the building so as to not disrupt any yoga classes that may be taking place.  If it is dark out or there is inclement weather I encourage you to call or text when you arrive so that we can make accomodations.</p>
